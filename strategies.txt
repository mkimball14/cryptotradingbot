# 📉 Trading Strategy Plan – Bearish Market (April 2025)

## 🧭 Objective
Test and optimize strategies suited for the current crypto market state (downtrend + high volatility). Focus on mean reversion, breakouts, and conservative trend filters.

---

## ✅ Strategy 1: Bollinger Band Reversion + RSI

**Goal**: Buy short-term oversold dips during volatility spikes.

### Tasks
- [ ] Fetch 4H BTC-USD candles from Coinbase API (last 60–90 days)
- [ ] Calculate Bollinger Bands (20 SMA, 2 std dev) and RSI(14)
- [ ] Entry Rule:
  - Price closes below lower BB
  - RSI < 30
  - Optional: high volume or bullish candle
- [ ] Exit when price returns to middle band or RSI > 50
- [ ] Add stop-loss below recent swing low
- [ ] Backtest and log: Win rate, Sharpe, drawdown, equity curve

---

## ✅ Strategy 2: Breakout Shorting with Volatility Squeeze

**Goal**: Catch breakdowns from low-volatility consolidations.

### Tasks
- [ ] Detect Bollinger Band “squeezes” using bandwidth percentile
- [ ] Entry Rule:
  - Break below range low during squeeze
  - Volume spike
  - RSI < 50 or MACD bear cross
- [ ] Stop-loss above range high, 2:1 risk/reward
- [ ] Backtest on BTC-USD, ETH-USD (1H or 4H)

---

## ✅ Strategy 3: RSI Momentum with Regime Filter

**Goal**: Only trade in clean uptrends, avoid whipsaws in downtrends.

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement regime detection using 20-MA slope + ATR
- [ ] Entry Rule:
  - RSI(14) crosses above 55
  - Regime == "uptrend"
- [ ] Exit on RSI < 45 or regime == "downtrend"
- [ ] Skip trades when regime is “downtrend”
- [ ] Compare with RSI-only strategy in backtest

---

## ✅ Strategy 4: Supply & Demand Zone Bounces

**Goal**: Buy near support zones with confirmation.

### Tasks
- [ ] Detect demand zones from swing lows + volume clusters
- [ ] Entry Rule:
  - Price touches demand zone
  - Bullish reversal candle
  - Optional: RSI > 30 or MACD cross
- [ ] Stop-loss just below zone, exit at mid-range or resistance
- [ ] Backtest independently

---

## ✅ Strategy 5 (Optional): LSTM Confirmation Model

**Goal**: Add AI prediction filter to reduce false signals.

### Tasks
- [ ] Train LSTM model to predict 4H direction (1 = up, 0 = down)
- [ ] Use features: OHLCV + RSI, MACD, Bollinger position
- [ ] Use model to confirm RSI or BB strategy entries
- [ ] Compare with and without LSTM filter in backtest

---

## 🧪 Paper Trading Setup

**Goal**: Simulate live trades using real-time data, no capital.

### Tasks
- [ ] Subscribe to Coinbase WebSocket for live prices
- [ ] Run strategy logic every 4H
- [ ] Log simulated trades with timestamp, price, strategy
- [ ] Track daily PnL and risk

## 🔢 Prioritization

| Strategy                          | Priority | Risk | Complexity |
|----------------------------------|----------|------|------------|
| Bollinger + RSI Reversion        | ✅ High   | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Easy     |
| RSI + Regime Filter              | ✅ High   | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Easy     |
| Volatility Squeeze Breakouts     | ✅ High   | 🟡 Med | 🟡 Medium   |
| Supply/Demand Zone Bounce        | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Med | 🟡 Medium   |
| LSTM Confirmation                | 🔜 Later  | 🔴 High| 🔴 Advanced |

## ✅ Final Notes

Start by testing **mean reversion and trend filtering** strategies.  
Once results are consistent, gradually layer in breakout and ML components.

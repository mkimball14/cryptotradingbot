# Market Regime-Aware Volume Detection for Crypto Trading Bot

## Overview

This enhancement builds on our enhanced volume detection system by integrating market regime awareness. The system now dynamically adjusts volume thresholds based on whether the market is trending or ranging, providing more context-appropriate signals.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Volume Thresholds**: Automatically adjusts based on market regime
- **Trending Market Mode**: Increases thresholds by 20% to reduce false signals in trends
- **Ranging Market Mode**: Decreases thresholds by 15% to catch early breakouts in ranges
- **Multiple Volume Indicators**: Combines 4 different volume signals with regime-appropriate sensitivity
- **Integrated Regime Detection**: Uses ADX to determine market regime (trending vs ranging)

## Implementation

The market regime-aware volume detection is implemented in:

1. **Enhanced Volume Detection Function**:
   - Updated `create_volume_divergence_indicator` function in `edge_multi_factor_fixed.py`
   - Added parameters for passing market regime information
   - Implemented dynamic threshold adjustment based on regime

2. **Testing Framework**:
   - New test script in `scripts/test_enhanced_volume.py` 
   - Compares regime-aware vs standard approaches
   - Generates visualization of signal differences

3. **Documentation**:
   - Updated `docs/enhanced_volume_detection.md` with regime awareness info
   - New results in `docs/market_regime_volume_results.md`

## Usage

### Running with Market Regime-Aware Volume Detection

```bash
python scripts/strategies/edge_multi_factor_fixed.py --profile enhanced_volume --symbol BTC-USD
```

### Testing the Implementation

```bash
python scripts/test_enhanced_volume.py
```

This will:
1. Generate signals using the regime-aware approach
2. Compare with signals from the standard approach
3. Create visualization plots showing differences

## Technical Implementation

The key implementation is the dynamic threshold adjustment:

```python
# Apply market regime-based threshold adjustments if regime data is provided
if is_trending is not None and is_ranging is not None:
    # Make volume thresholds more strict during trending periods (reduce false signals)
    trending_adjustment = 1.2  # Increase threshold by 20% during trends
    ranging_adjustment = 0.85  # Decrease threshold by 15% during ranges
    
    # Apply adjustments based on market regimes
    adapted_volume_threshold[is_trending] *= trending_adjustment
    adapted_volume_threshold[is_ranging] *= ranging_adjustment
```

## Test Results

Testing shows that while the total number of signals remained similar, the regime-aware approach:
- Generated different signals at different times
- Better aligned signals with market context
- Improved signal timing within each regime

## Next Steps

Planned improvements for the market regime-aware volume detection:

1. **Develop Regime-Specific Exit Strategies**: Create exit rules tailored to each market regime
2. **Tune Adjustment Factors**: Optimize the threshold adjustment percentages
3. **Implement Continuous Regime Scale**: Move from binary classification to a continuous measure
4. **Add Time-Based Considerations**: Incorporate time-of-day effects on volume
5. **Extended Backtesting**: Test across various market conditions and longer periods

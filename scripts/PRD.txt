1. Trading Strategy Review
A. Supply/Demand Zone Logic
Pro: Supply/demand (S/D) zones are a popular, price-action-focused approach that can work well for capturing swing trades or intraday moves.

Potential Refinements:

Confirmation Signals: S/D zones alone can produce many false signals. Including confirmations (like RSI divergence, volume spikes, or price-pattern triggers) is a good step. Consider testing different confluences (e.g., volume profile or 2- to 3-candle momentum shifts) to filter out weaker zones.

Order Flow & Liquidity: If BloFin’s API or data sources can provide more granular order-flow details (like the order book, liquidity pools, or large trades), these insights could sharpen zone accuracy.

Adaptive Timeframes: Beyond static 1H/4H/15m, consider adaptive logic when volatility changes. In quieter markets, you might do better with a higher timeframe; in more volatile periods, your 15m or even 5m entries might need additional filters.

B. Risk Management
Pro: Limiting risk to 1–2% of account balance per trade is a tried-and-true approach.

Potential Refinements:

Dynamic Position Sizing: Instead of a fixed 2% across all trades, some strategies use dynamic sizing based on trade confidence or zone “freshness score.” For example, if the zone has a high confidence score (due to multiple confluences), allow a slightly higher risk; if it’s a “weak” zone, limit risk to 0.5–1%.

Volatility Adjustments: If markets are highly volatile, consider capping absolute position size (not just risk %). This prevents extreme position sizes when daily ATR is unusually large.

C. Additional Strategy Ideas
Time/Session Filter: You mention an optional time-of-day filter to avoid low-liquidity hours. This can be significant in crypto, especially if BloFin’s liquidity fluctuates heavily on certain pairs or off-peak hours.

Trade Frequency & Overtrading Checks: If the bot systematically tries to place too many trades in choppy conditions, you could add a cooldown period after a stop-out or winning trade.

Portfolio Approach (Future Extension): If you eventually want to trade multiple symbols, consider correlation-based risk management (i.e., if you’re long BTCUSDT and ETHUSDT at the same time, you might effectively be doubling your risk if they’re highly correlated).

2. Technology & Architecture Review
A. MCP Server & Tooling
Pro: Using a Python-based MCP server with well-defined tools (e.g., get_ohlcv(), detect_zones(), etc.) encourages modular, testable architecture.

Potential Refinements:

State Management: You mention “stateless and stateful tools” plus “persistent session state.” Be sure to define which parts of the system handle persistent vs. ephemeral data. Logging and partial trade states (SL/TP in progress) should be robustly stored (e.g., DB or on-disk).

Testing & Mocking: Because this is a real-money environment, thorough unit tests (with mocked BloFin API responses) and integration tests (dry-run on real data) are critical. The MCP tool concept lends itself nicely to mocking each “tool.”

B. Exchange Integration
Pro: BloFin REST + WebSocket is straightforward for real-time price feeds.

Potential Refinements:

Latency & Order Execution: If your strategy is somewhat intraday or short-term, you’ll want to ensure minimal API latency. Batch or queue order requests if the system expects to place multiple orders at once (e.g., partial scale-ins, bracket orders).

Backups/Fallback: Even if you’re BloFin-focused, building a minimal abstraction layer (like CCXT) might let you pivot to a fallback exchange or multi-exchange approach in the future without rewriting your core logic.

C. Web UI
Pro: FastAPI + Tailwind/HTMX or Streamlit is a quick way to stand up a minimal UI.

Potential Refinements:

Deciding FastAPI + HTMX/Tailwind vs. Streamlit:

FastAPI + HTMX is more flexible, production-grade, and better if you want a more custom UI or if you want fine control over authentication, user management, etc.

Streamlit is simpler to implement for data dashboards but has fewer production-grade features out of the box.

Hosting & Security: Keep secrets (API keys, etc.) off the front end and ensure you have standard production hardening (HTTPS, authentication for your dashboard, etc.).

D. Data Storage & Analytics
Pro: Lightweight storage (SQLite) is often sufficient for logs and state.

Potential Refinements:

Trade & Zone Analytics: Over time, you’ll want robust analytics on zone success rates, average R:R, and other performance metrics. Storing the raw data in a structured DB (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.) helps you quickly run retrospective analysis.

3. Future Extensions & “Best Practices”
A. Backtesting & Forward Testing
You already mention backtesting and dry-run modes. Make sure you have:

Robust Historical Data: Enough candle data to meaningfully test your S/D strategy in varying market conditions (bull/bear, high/low volatility, etc.).

Forward Testing on Paper Trading / Demo Account: A multi-week forward test in demo mode is essential before going live.

B. Adaptive / ML-Based Approaches
Pro: You mention an “ML-based zone scoring” extension. This can be potent if you have enough data to train a model on which zones historically performed best (size of move, time to fill, etc.).

Caution: ML-based approaches can overfit easily. Keep that in mind when designing your feature sets and doing cross-validation.

C. Slippage & Fees
Make sure your backtest includes realistic transaction fees, plus average slippage estimates—especially if you’ll be placing market orders in thin liquidity. This is often overlooked and can distort strategy expectations.

D. Monitoring & Fail-Safes
Beyond your halt_trading() kill-switch, consider:

Circuit Breakers: If daily drawdown > X% or if the bot experiences consecutive stop-outs, auto-halt or switch to “manual approval only” mode.

Notifications & Alerts: Telegram/Discord/email alerts for trade executions or margin calls can be extremely helpful if something goes wrong.

4. Summary & Recommendations
Strategy Upgrades

Add or refine entry confirmations to reduce false positives.

Consider dynamic risk sizing or volatility-adjusted entries.

Keep an eye on potential overfitting if you add ML or advanced zone scoring.

Architecture & Tooling

Clearly separate modules for strategy logic, risk management, exchange connectivity, and logging.

Expand on robust testing frameworks and fallback measures in case of API or connection issues.

Web UI & Operational Reliability

Decide carefully between a simpler Streamlit approach vs. a more flexible FastAPI + Tailwind/HTMX approach.

Protect the UI with authentication and SSL if you’re exposing it publicly.

Data & Analytics

Store all trade and zone-level data to systematically review results.

Incorporate fees, slippage, and partial fill logic into your backtesting engine to ensure realistic performance metrics.

With these considerations in place, your PRD lays a solid foundation for a safe and modular BloFin Isolated Futures trading bot. By enhancing confirmations for the supply/demand zones, implementing thorough testing (backtest & forward test), and maintaining strong risk controls (with potential dynamic sizing and circuit-breaker logic), you can significantly improve your bot’s real-world reliability and performance.

Below is an integrated PRD that includes all original content plus the additional recommendations and refinements. Everything is now merged into one cohesive document.

PRD: BloFin Isolated Futures Crypto Trading Bot (MCP Server)
1. Overview
Develop an automated crypto trading bot system to trade BloFin USDT-M Isolated Futures, using supply and demand (S/D) zone logic, multi-timeframe analysis, real-time price updates, and strict risk controls. The system will be built as a modular MCP server, supporting:

Agentic interfaces via Cursor AI (via well-defined “tools”).

Human monitoring via a lightweight Web UI.

Future extensions such as adaptive ML-based zone scoring, deeper analytics, and automated trade optimization.

2. Goals
Trade isolated futures on BloFin using structured price action logic (S/D zones) augmented with optional filters.

Maintain strict risk controls (e.g., ≤2% account risk per trade), plus robust operational reliability (fail-safes, kill-switch).

Expose system internals as MCP tools for AI or programmatic use.

Provide a lightweight Web UI to monitor the bot, view trade states, analyze zone performance, and toggle execution modes.

Establish a clear path for future enhancements (e.g., ML-based zone scoring, multi-symbol support).

3. Key Features
3.1 Strategy Logic
Supply/Demand Zone Detection

Identify drop-base-rally / rally-base-drop patterns.

Tag zones with “freshness” and “confidence” (or “strength”) scores to gauge quality.

Multi-Timeframe Analysis

Use 1H/4H zones for overall trend context.

Refine entries on the 15m chart (or adapt 5m if volatility is high).

Entry Validation & Filters

Optional checks:

RSI divergence or oversold/overbought conditions.

Volume spikes near zones.

Candle-structure confirmations (e.g., 2-3 candle momentum shifts).

Risk Management

1–2% max account risk per trade as a baseline.

Stop-loss and take-profit management automatically enforced.

Dynamic or Adaptive Sizing (recommended refinement):

Increase position size slightly on higher-confidence zones, and reduce risk to 0.5–1% for weaker setups or uncertain market conditions.

Volatility Adjustments (recommended refinement):

Cap absolute position size if the market’s ATR or volatility is unusually high.

Zone Freshness & Confidence

Only trade zones that have not been overly “tested” (i.e., price has touched them too many times).

Factor in confluences (RSI, volume, momentum patterns) to adjust zone scoring.

Additional Strategy Ideas (Recommended Refinements)

Time-of-day filter: Option to avoid low-liquidity hours.

Overtrading/cooldown checks: Option to reduce trade frequency in choppy markets or after a series of consecutive stop-outs.

Portfolio approach (when multi-symbol is enabled): Manage correlated trades (e.g., BTC and ETH) to avoid doubling risk inadvertently.

3.2 Exchange Integration
BloFin REST + WebSocket

Secure real-time price feeds.

Support for reading account data, placing and managing orders.

Isolated Margin only (no cross-margin).

Order Types:

Market, Limit, Stop, Reduce-Only (for partial or final TP).

Demo vs. Live:

Ability to toggle between paper trading (demo) and live execution.

Fallback/Abstraction Layer (recommended refinement):

If feasible, consider an exchange abstraction (e.g., CCXT) to allow quick pivoting to other exchanges or multi-exchange support in the future.

3.3 Execution Engine
Python-based MCP Server

Exposes a collection of “tools” (stateless/stateful) for agentic or programmatic interactions.

Real-time Price & Signal Loop

Subscribes to WebSocket streams for near-live candle/price data.

Processes signals in near real-time (consider order-execution latency).

Trade Mode Flexibility

Backtest: Use historical data in the same logic pipeline.

Dry-run: Simulate live trades on real-time data without placing real orders.

Live: Actual trade execution on BloFin.

Persistent Session State

Store partial trades (SL, TP triggers) in a DB (e.g., SQLite) to handle restarts gracefully.

SL/TP Auto-Enforcement

Real-time checks to move stops or close out trades upon signals/hit triggers.

Fail-Safes & Circuit Breakers (recommended refinement):

Optional daily max drawdown or consecutive stop-out threshold that auto-halts trading.

halt_trading() kill-switch to immediately stop all new orders.

4. MCP Tooling
Below is a non-exhaustive list of proposed tools. Each tool is modular and can be used by either the main bot logic, a monitoring script, or an AI “agent” within Cursor.

Tool Name	Description
get_ohlcv(symbol)	Fetch historical candle data for backtesting/analysis.
get_latest_price()	Return real-time ticker price from BloFin’s WebSocket or REST.
detect_zones()	Compute supply/demand zones from OHLCV data.
check_signal()	Apply entry logic (e.g., S/D zone confluence, RSI filters) and return buy/sell/hold.
place_order()	Execute a trade using isolated margin. Includes dynamic sizing logic.
get_positions()	View all open futures positions.
log_trade()	Record trade metadata (entry price, SL, TP, zone ID, tags) in DB.
analyze_zones()	Compute zone “hit rate” and measure overall zone strength.
halt_trading()	Immediately stop all trade actions (kill-switch).
Testing & Mocking (recommended refinement):

Each tool should be mockable for robust unit and integration testing. E.g., simulate BloFin API responses or create synthetic markets.

5. Web UI
5.1 Purpose
A lightweight user-facing dashboard to:

Monitor active trades and PnL in real time.

Visualize supply/demand zones and show zone freshness/confidence.

Toggle bot states (run, dry-run, pause, or halt).

Initiate backtests or analytics (one-click).

View system logs and alerts to quickly spot issues or confirm killswitch triggers.

5.2 Technology
Framework

Option A: FastAPI + Tailwind CSS + HTMX for a fully customizable production-grade app.

Option B: Streamlit for a quicker, data-centric UI build.

(Recommendation: If you want more control over authentication, security, routing, and future expansions, go with FastAPI + a lightweight front-end stack.)

Charting: Plotly.js or Chart.js for zone visualization and real-time price overlays.

Hosting & Security

Host the Web UI behind HTTPS.

Include basic authentication or IP whitelisting to protect your trading dashboard.

Keep API credentials on the server side, never exposed in front-end code.

5.3 Planned Pages

Zone Map	Chart of current S/D zones, color-coded by freshness & confidence score
Trade Log	Historical trades with filters (date range, R:R, win/loss, zone ID)
Settings	Risk parameters, toggle dry-run, set max drawdown, set time-of-day filters
6. Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.10+

Server: FastAPI (MCP + Web UI backend) or potentially separate for the UI if using Streamlit.

Exchange SDK: Native BloFin REST + WebSocket or CCXT for more generic exchange coverage.

Data/Analytics:

pandas, numpy, TA-Lib for technical analysis and zone detection.

Potential for an ML library (scikit-learn, PyTorch) if implementing advanced zone scoring.

Database (Optional): SQLite for logs, trades, system states. (Upgrade to PostgreSQL if needed.)

Agent Integration: Cursor MCP + an “Agent Mode” that can call these tools programmatically.

7. Milestones
MVP

 API Connection: Connect to BloFin (REST + WebSocket); fetch OHLCV + account data.

 Zone Detection & Entry Logic: Base S/D logic with at least one confluence filter (e.g., RSI).

 SL/TP Enforcement: Automated bracket orders or immediate stop/limit triggers.

 Risk Controls: 1–2% risk per trade, with possible dynamic sizing in place.

 Logging & Stats: Record each trade; generate simple performance metrics.

 Dry-Run & Backtest Modes: Confirm that the same logic pipeline can run on historical data or in real-time paper mode.

Web UI Phase
 API Endpoints: For bot state, logs, and open trades in real time.

 Dashboard: Minimal page to show status, trades, PnL, and toggles (run/halt/dry-run).

 Zone Map Visualization: Chart S/D zones overlaid on price data.

 Trade Log: Filterable table of historical trades.

Extended Testing & Production Hardening
 Forward Test in demo mode for multiple weeks under different market conditions.

 Circuit Breakers for daily max loss, consecutive stop-outs, etc.

 Security Hardening and hosting environment (HTTPS, auth, error monitoring).

 Go Live with partial capital, then scale up after stable performance.

8. Future Extensions
ML-Based Zone Scoring
Train a model to predict the “strength” or outcome of a zone based on historical performance, volume flow, macro trend, etc.

Caution: Avoid overfitting; cross-validate on multiple market regimes.

Auto-Parameter Tuning
Adjust S/D zone parameters, risk levels, or confluence thresholds using backtest data, genetic algorithms, or Bayesian optimization.

Multi-Symbol Support
Trade multiple symbols concurrently with correlation-based risk management (avoid doubling up on correlated assets).

Agent-Driven Optimization
Let an AI agent from Cursor or another framework systematically tweak strategy parameters or risk controls.

Alerts & Notifications
Telegram, Discord, or email for real-time notifications (trade fill, stop triggered, margin issues).

Failover & Auto-Restart
If the system or exchange connection fails, automatically attempt to reconnect or fail over to a backup environment.

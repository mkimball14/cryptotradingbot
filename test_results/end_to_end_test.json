    "RSI Window": {
      "SuggestedValue": 21,
      "Explanation": "Increasing the RSI window will smooth out the RSI curve, potentially reducing the number of false signals in trending markets by capturing a longer term view."
    },
    "RSI Entry (Oversold)": {
      "SuggestedValue": 25,
      "Explanation": "Lowering the oversold threshold can help ensure that you're entering trades that have a stronger potential for reversal, as a value of 25 is more indicative of an oversold condition."
    },
    "RSI Exit (Overbought)": {
      "SuggestedValue": 75,
      "Explanation": "Increasing the overbought threshold to 75 might allow trades more room to run during strong trends before exiting, potentially capturing a larger part of the move."
    },
    "Bollinger Bands Window": {
      "SuggestedValue": 14,
      "Explanation": "Reducing the window for Bollinger Bands can make the indicator more responsive to market movements, which may be beneficial in faster-moving markets."
    },
    "Bollinger Bands Deviation": {
      "SuggestedValue": 2.5,
      "Explanation": "Increasing the deviation creates a wider channel that could help in filtering out noise and reducing the number of exit signals during volatile but trending markets."
    },
    "Volatility Window (ATR)": {
      "SuggestedValue": 14,
      "Explanation": "A shorter window for ATR can make the volatility measure more responsive to recent market changes, which can be beneficial for adjusting stop loss and take profit levels more dynamically."
    },
    "Volatility Threshold": {
      "SuggestedValue": 1.0,
      "Explanation": "Lowering the threshold may allow for the inclusion of more trading opportunities by recognizing smaller, yet significant, moves as actionable volatility."
    },
    "Stop Loss Percentage": {
      "SuggestedValue": 1.5,
      "Explanation": "Lowering the stop loss percentage can help in reducing the risk per trade, making the strategy more resilient to volatility and drawdowns."
    },
    "Take Profit Percentage": {
      "SuggestedValue": 3.5,
      "Explanation": "Adjusting the take profit percentage slightly lower can potentially lead to a higher hit rate of reaching profit targets, even though it sacrifices some upside on trades."
    },
    "Risk Per Trade": {
      "SuggestedValue": 1.5,
      "Explanation": "Reducing the risk per trade can provide a more conservative approach to money management, potentially leading to a smoother equity curve by mitigating losses during drawdowns."
    },

        },
        "Explanation": "Integrating the MACD can provide additional trend-following and momentum signals, helping to confirm entries and exits signaled by the strategy's existing components."
      },
      {
        "Name": "Fibonacci Retracement",
        "Explanation": "Using Fibonacci retracement levels can offer dynamic support and resistance levels for better entry and exit points, especially in conjunction with RSI and Bollinger Bands."

        "summary": "The backtest results indicate that the cryptocurrency trading strategy underperformed, generating a negative total return of approximately -8.07% from 6 trades. The Sharpe ratio of -2.73 further suggests that the risk-adjusted returns are poor, and the maximum drawdown equals the total negative return, indicating that the strategy's losses were consistent throughout the testing period. A win rate of 0% shows that none of the trades were profitable.",

          "profitability": "The strategy failed to generate any profitable trades, indicating issues with signal generation or execution.",
          "risk_adjusted_return": "A very low Sharpe ratio points to inadequate compensation for the risks taken.",
          "drawdown": "The max drawdown being equal to the total return suggests a lack of effective risk mitigation techniques in place."

# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Supply/Demand Zone Detection Algorithm
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core zone detection logic to identify drop-base-rally and rally-base-drop patterns with quality scoring
# Details:
1. Create detect_zones() function to identify S/D zones
2. Implement pattern recognition for drop-base-rally and rally-base-drop
3. Add 'freshness' and 'confidence' scoring algorithms
4. Implement zone metadata storage
5. Create RSI confluence filter
6. Develop multi-timeframe analysis logic
7. Add functions to update zone status based on price action

# Test Strategy:
Backtest zone detection against historical data with known S/D zones. Validate scoring accuracy with manual review. Test performance on different market conditions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Base Pattern Recognition Logic [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core functions to detect drop-base-rally (demand) and rally-base-drop (supply) patterns in price data
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a new module `zone_detection.py` with a `detect_zones()` function that takes OHLCV data as input
2. Implement pattern recognition algorithm for drop-base-rally (demand zones):
   - Identify significant price drops (using ATR or percentage-based thresholds)
   - Detect consolidation areas (bases) after drops where price moves sideways
   - Identify rallies after the base formation
3. Implement pattern recognition for rally-base-drop (supply zones):
   - Identify significant price rallies
   - Detect consolidation areas after rallies
   - Identify drops after the base formation
4. Extract key zone information: entry point, exit point, high/low boundaries
5. Return detected zones as a structured data format (list of dictionaries)

Testing approach:
- Create unit tests with known price patterns to verify detection accuracy
- Visualize detected patterns on sample charts to manually verify correctness

## 2. Develop Zone Scoring Algorithms [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement algorithms to score detected zones based on 'freshness' (recency) and 'confidence' (pattern quality)
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Extend the zone detection module to add scoring functionality
2. Implement 'freshness' scoring algorithm:
   - Calculate time elapsed since zone formation
   - Apply decay function to reduce score as zones age
   - Normalize scores to 0-100 range
3. Implement 'confidence' scoring algorithm based on pattern quality:
   - Score based on clarity of the base formation (tightness of consolidation)
   - Score based on strength of preceding move (drop or rally magnitude)
   - Score based on volume characteristics during pattern formation
   - Score based on candlestick patterns within the base
4. Create a combined quality score that weights freshness and confidence
5. Add scoring data to zone metadata

Testing approach:
- Unit test each scoring component with controlled inputs
- Create test cases for zones of varying quality to verify scoring accuracy
- Implement visualization of scored zones to verify intuitive results

## 3. Implement Zone Metadata Management [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Create data structures and functions to store, retrieve, and manage zone metadata
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a comprehensive zone metadata structure including:
   - Zone type (supply/demand)
   - Price boundaries (entry, exit, high, low)
   - Formation timestamps (start, end)
   - Scoring information (freshness, confidence, combined score)
   - Current status (active, tested, broken, untested)
   - Historical interactions with price
2. Implement functions to create and store zone metadata
3. Create serialization/deserialization methods for persistence
4. Implement query functions to retrieve zones by type, status, score, etc.
5. Add functionality to track zone interactions across time

Testing approach:
- Unit test metadata creation with various zone types
- Test serialization/deserialization for data integrity
- Verify query functions return expected results
- Test with large datasets to ensure efficient storage and retrieval

## 4. Develop RSI Confluence and Filtering Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.3
### Description: Implement RSI-based filtering to improve zone quality and add confluence detection
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Extend zone detection to incorporate RSI (Relative Strength Index) analysis
2. Implement RSI calculation function or integrate with existing indicators
3. Create filtering logic to identify zones with RSI confluence:
   - For demand zones: identify when RSI is in oversold territory
   - For supply zones: identify when RSI is in overbought territory
4. Add RSI values to zone metadata
5. Implement functions to filter zones based on RSI confluence criteria
6. Create scoring adjustment based on RSI confluence strength

Testing approach:
- Unit test RSI calculation against known values
- Test filtering logic with various RSI scenarios
- Verify that high-confluence zones have appropriate score adjustments
- Create visualization tests to confirm RSI confluence visually

## 5. Implement Multi-timeframe Analysis and Zone Status Updates [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Develop functionality for multi-timeframe zone analysis and dynamic status updates based on price action
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement multi-timeframe zone detection:
   - Create functions to detect zones across different timeframes
   - Develop logic to merge/align zones from different timeframes
   - Implement scoring adjustments for zones confirmed across timeframes
2. Create zone status update functionality:
   - Implement logic to detect when price approaches a zone
   - Create functions to update zone status when price tests a zone
   - Develop logic to mark zones as broken when price moves through them
   - Add functions to track repeated tests of the same zone
3. Implement zone strength reassessment based on price interaction
4. Create event notification system for zone status changes
5. Develop functions to clean up/archive old or invalid zones

Testing approach:
- Test with historical data spanning multiple timeframes
- Create scenarios with zone tests, breaks, and retests
- Verify correct status transitions in various price action scenarios
- Test notification system for expected alerts
- Verify zone cleanup works correctly for outdated zones

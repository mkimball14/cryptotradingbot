# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Session Persistence and Recovery
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create mechanisms to maintain system state and recover from crashes or restarts
# Details:
1. Design persistent session state storage
2. Implement state serialization and deserialization
3. Create recovery procedures for system restarts
4. Add position reconciliation with exchange
5. Implement order status synchronization
6. Develop automatic trade recovery
7. Create system health monitoring

# Test Strategy:
Test system recovery after forced shutdowns. Verify position and order state after restarts. Validate reconciliation with exchange data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Persistent State Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a storage mechanism for system state that persists across system restarts and crashes
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Design a database schema for storing system state (consider using SQLite or a similar embedded database)
2. Create data models for various system states (open orders, positions, account balances, etc.)
3. Implement functions to write state to persistent storage at regular intervals
4. Add transaction support to ensure data integrity during writes
5. Implement logging for all state changes
6. Create configuration options for storage location and backup frequency

Testing approach:
- Unit test storage and retrieval operations
- Test transaction rollback on failure
- Simulate power outage during write operations
- Benchmark performance to ensure minimal impact on system operations

## 2. Implement State Serialization and Recovery Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create mechanisms to serialize/deserialize system state and procedures to recover state after system restart
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Develop serialization/deserialization methods for all system state objects
2. Implement versioning for serialized data to handle format changes
3. Create a recovery manager class that orchestrates the recovery process
4. Implement startup detection of incomplete shutdown
5. Add incremental recovery to restore from the most recent valid state
6. Create recovery sequence ordering to ensure dependent systems are restored in correct order

Testing approach:
- Test serialization/deserialization with various data scenarios
- Verify recovery from corrupted state files
- Test version migration of serialized data
- Simulate various crash scenarios and verify recovery

## 3. Implement Exchange Reconciliation for Positions and Orders [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create mechanisms to reconcile local state with exchange data for positions and orders after recovery
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Implement API calls to fetch current positions and open orders from exchanges
2. Create comparison logic to identify discrepancies between local and exchange state
3. Develop reconciliation rules for handling mismatches (e.g., missing orders, different position sizes)
4. Implement automatic correction of local state based on exchange data
5. Add manual intervention flags for critical discrepancies
6. Create detailed logging of all reconciliation actions

Testing approach:
- Test with simulated discrepancies between local and exchange state
- Verify correct handling of various edge cases (partial fills, rejected orders)
- Test performance with large numbers of positions and orders
- Create integration tests with exchange API mocks

## 4. Implement Trade Recovery and System Health Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Create mechanisms for automatic trade recovery and continuous system health monitoring
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Develop a trade recovery system that can replay missing trade actions after a crash
2. Implement prioritization for recovery actions based on market conditions
3. Create a health monitoring subsystem that tracks system vitals (memory usage, CPU, disk space)
4. Add alerting mechanisms for critical health issues (email, SMS, dashboard)
5. Implement periodic health checks for all subsystems
6. Create a recovery status dashboard showing recovery progress and system health
7. Develop automatic failover mechanisms for critical components

Testing approach:
- Test trade recovery with various market scenarios
- Simulate resource constraints to verify health monitoring
- Test alert delivery through all channels
- Verify dashboard accuracy during recovery scenarios
- Conduct stress tests to ensure recovery works under load

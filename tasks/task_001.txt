# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Scaffold and Coinbase Advanced API Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the FastAPI-based MCP server structure and implement Coinbase Advanced API connection for both REST and WebSocket data streams
# Details:
1. Initialize Python project with FastAPI framework
2. Implement Coinbase Advanced API client with authentication
3. Create REST endpoints for account data, order placement, and market information
4. Set up WebSocket connection for real-time price updates
5. Implement error handling and reconnection logic
6. Create basic data models for market data
7. Add configuration management for API keys and settings

# Test Strategy:
Verify API connectivity by fetching account balance and market data. Test WebSocket connection stability over 24 hours. Ensure proper error handling with mocked API failures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize FastAPI Project Structure with Configuration Management [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic FastAPI project structure with configuration management for API keys and environment settings
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a new Python project with appropriate directory structure (app/, tests/, etc.)
2. Set up virtual environment and install required packages (fastapi, uvicorn, httpx, websockets, pydantic, coinbase-advanced-py)
3. Create a main.py file with FastAPI application initialization
4. Implement configuration management using environment variables and/or config files
   - Create config.py for managing Coinbase API keys, URLs, and other settings
   - Implement loading from .env file for local development
   - Add validation for required configuration values
5. Create basic project documentation (README.md)
6. Set up logging configuration
7. Testing approach: Write unit tests for configuration loading and validation

## 2. Implement Coinbase Advanced API Client with Authentication [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create a client module for Coinbase Advanced API with authentication handling and basic request functionality
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a dedicated coinbase_client.py module within the app/
2. Implement API client class with:
   - Authentication method using Coinbase API keys from configuration
   - HTTP request methods (get, post, put, delete) with proper headers
   - Request signing mechanism according to Coinbase Advanced API requirements
   - Rate limiting and throttling mechanisms based on Coinbase limits
3. Create data models (using Pydantic) for API responses
4. Implement session management with connection pooling
5. Add basic error handling for connection issues
6. Testing approach:
   - Mock HTTP responses to test authentication logic
   - Unit test request formation and signing
   - Create integration tests with Coinbase sandbox environment

## 3. Create REST API Endpoints for Account and Market Data [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Implement FastAPI endpoints that connect to Coinbase Advanced API for account information, order placement, and market data
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create router modules for different endpoint categories:
   - app/routers/account.py for account-related endpoints
   - app/routers/orders.py for order management
   - app/routers/market.py for market data
2. Implement specific endpoints in each router:
   - GET /account/balance - retrieve account balances
   - GET /account/positions - get current positions
   - POST /orders - place new orders with validation
   - GET /orders/{id} - retrieve order details
   - GET /market/instruments - list available trading instruments
   - GET /market/ticker/{symbol} - get current ticker information
3. Create request/response models using Pydantic
4. Implement proper error handling with meaningful error responses
5. Add input validation using Pydantic models
6. Include endpoint documentation using FastAPI's built-in docs
7. Testing approach:
   - Unit tests for request validation
   - Integration tests with Coinbase sandbox
   - Test error scenarios and edge cases

## 4. Implement WebSocket Connection for Real-time Market Data [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up WebSocket client to connect to Coinbase Advanced API's real-time data feeds and expose WebSocket endpoints for clients
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a dedicated websocket_client.py module
2. Implement WebSocket connection to Coinbase Advanced API:
   - Authentication and connection establishment using API keys
   - Message parsing and handling for Coinbase's message format
   - Subscription management for different market data channels
   - Heartbeat mechanism as per Coinbase's requirements
   - Reconnection logic with exponential backoff
3. Create data models for WebSocket messages
4. Implement a WebSocket server endpoint in FastAPI to relay data to clients:
   - Create /ws/{stream} endpoint for client connections
   - Implement client subscription management
   - Add message forwarding from Coinbase to connected clients
5. Create an in-memory cache for latest market data
6. Implement proper error handling for WebSocket connections
7. Testing approach:
   - Unit tests for message parsing
   - Mock WebSocket server for testing client reconnection
   - Load testing for multiple client connections

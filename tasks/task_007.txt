# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Trade Logging and Performance Tracking
# Status: in_progress
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build comprehensive logging system for trades and performance metrics
# Details:
1. Design database schema for trade records
2. Implement trade logging for entries, exits, and adjustments
3. Create performance metrics tracking (daily/weekly/monthly PnL)
4. Add trade visualization data preparation
5. Implement export functionality for trade data
6. Create system state logging
7. Develop error and warning logging

# Test Strategy:
Verify complete trade history capture. Test performance calculation accuracy. Validate data integrity during system restarts.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Trade Database Schema and Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the database schema for trade records and implement the core logging functionality for trade entries, exits, and adjustments
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design database schema with tables for trades, trade_actions (entries/exits/adjustments), positions, and trade_metadata
2. Include fields for timestamps, trade type, instrument, quantity, price, fees, tags, notes
3. Create database migration scripts
4. Implement TradeLogger class with methods for logEntry(), logExit(), logAdjustment()
5. Add validation for required fields and data integrity
6. Implement transaction handling to ensure atomic operations
7. Create unit tests with mock trade data
8. Test database schema with various trade scenarios (entries, partial exits, full exits, adjustments)
9. Add indexes for common query patterns

Testing approach:
- Unit test the TradeLogger class methods
- Test database schema with sample trade data
- Verify data integrity constraints
- Test error handling for invalid inputs

## 2. Implement Performance Metrics Calculation and Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create the performance metrics calculation system with daily/weekly/monthly PnL tracking and reporting
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create PerformanceTracker class that interfaces with the trade database
2. Implement methods to calculate realized and unrealized PnL
3. Add time-based aggregation for daily/weekly/monthly performance metrics
4. Implement drawdown calculation and tracking
5. Create methods for win/loss ratios, average win/loss size, and profit factor
6. Add position sizing metrics and risk analysis
7. Implement caching mechanism for frequently accessed metrics
8. Add background job for end-of-day performance calculations
9. Create unit tests for all calculation methods

Testing approach:
- Test calculations with known trade sequences and expected outcomes
- Verify time-based aggregations across day/week/month boundaries
- Test edge cases (no trades, losing trades only, winning trades only)
- Benchmark performance for large trade datasets

## 3. Develop Visualization Data Preparation and Export Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Create data preparation methods for trade visualization and implement export functionality for trade data and system logs
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create DataVisualizer class to transform trade and performance data into visualization-ready formats
2. Implement methods to generate time-series data for equity curves
3. Add trade clustering and pattern recognition data preparation
4. Create exporters for CSV, JSON, and Excel formats
5. Implement system state logging with configurable verbosity levels
6. Add error and warning logging with severity classification
7. Create a unified logging interface that captures system events, errors, and warnings
8. Implement log rotation and archiving
9. Add data filtering options for exports (by date range, instrument, trade outcome)

Testing approach:
- Test visualization data output against expected formats
- Verify export functionality with sample data across all supported formats
- Test system logging with various event types and severity levels
- Validate log rotation and archiving with simulated time progression

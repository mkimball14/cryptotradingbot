# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Risk Management System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the risk management module to enforce position sizing, stop-loss, and take-profit rules
# Details:
1. Implement position sizing based on 1-2% account risk
2. Create stop-loss calculation logic
3. Develop take-profit targeting based on zone analysis
4. Add dynamic sizing based on zone confidence
5. Implement circuit breaker conditions
6. Create risk parameter validation
7. Add account balance monitoring

# Test Strategy:
Test position sizing with various account balances. Verify stop-loss enforcement with simulated price movements. Validate circuit breaker triggers under extreme conditions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Position Sizing and Risk Calculation Core [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the foundation of the risk management system with position sizing calculations based on account risk percentage and core risk parameter validation
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a `RiskManager` class with methods for calculating position sizes
2. Implement the core position sizing formula: Position Size = (Account Balance × Risk Percentage) ÷ (Entry Price - Stop Loss Price)
3. Add risk parameter validation for acceptable risk percentages (1-2%)
4. Implement account balance monitoring to fetch current balance
5. Create unit tests with various account sizes and risk parameters
6. Test edge cases like very small account balances, maximum allowed risk
7. Ensure position sizes are rounded to appropriate decimal places based on the instrument
8. Add logging for risk calculations for later auditing

## 2. Implement Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop the logic for calculating stop-loss levels and take-profit targets based on market analysis and risk parameters
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Extend the `RiskManager` class with stop-loss calculation methods
2. Implement ATR-based stop-loss calculations: Stop Distance = ATR × Multiplier
3. Add support for fixed pip/point-based stop-loss calculations
4. Implement take-profit targeting using risk-reward ratios (1:2, 1:3)
5. Add zone-based take-profit calculations using support/resistance levels
6. Create methods to validate stop-loss distances (prevent too tight stops)
7. Implement tests with mock price data and various market volatility scenarios
8. Add safety checks to ensure stop-loss is never beyond max allowable risk

## 3. Implement Dynamic Position Sizing Based on Zone Confidence [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Create a system that adjusts position size based on trading zone confidence levels and market conditions
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a `ConfidenceCalculator` component that interfaces with the zone analysis system
2. Implement confidence scoring algorithm (0-100%) based on multiple indicators
3. Add position size modifiers based on confidence scores:
   - High confidence (>80%): Use full calculated position size
   - Medium confidence (50-80%): Use 75% of calculated size
   - Low confidence (<50%): Use 50% of calculated size or skip trade
4. Implement position size caps based on volatility measures
5. Add methods to document confidence factors for each trade
6. Create unit tests for all calculation methods
7. Implement integration tests with mock zone analysis data
8. Add configuration options for confidence thresholds and modifiers

## 4. Implement Circuit Breaker and Advanced Risk Controls [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Develop circuit breaker mechanisms to halt trading under specific conditions and implement advanced risk monitoring features
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a `CircuitBreaker` component that monitors trading conditions
2. Implement consecutive loss detection (halt after X consecutive losses)
3. Add daily loss limit monitoring (halt if daily drawdown exceeds Y%)
4. Implement unusual volatility detection using ATR comparisons
5. Create time-based circuit breakers (e.g., no trading during high-impact news)
6. Add methods to gradually reduce position sizes after losses
7. Implement account balance threshold warnings
8. Create a dashboard/reporting system for risk metrics
9. Add unit tests for all circuit breaker conditions
10. Implement integration tests simulating various market conditions
11. Create a manual override system for emergency situations

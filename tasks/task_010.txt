# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Zone Visualization and Advanced Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Create visual representation of supply/demand zones and advanced monitoring capabilities
# Details:
1. Implement charting library integration
2. Create zone visualization overlay
3. Add price action display with entry/exit points
4. Implement multi-timeframe chart switching
5. Create alert system for zone touches
6. Add custom indicator visualization
7. Implement performance analytics dashboard

# Test Strategy:
Verify zone rendering accuracy. Test chart responsiveness and data accuracy. Validate alert system functionality. Test visualization performance with multiple zones.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Charting Library and Implement Basic Zone Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a charting library and implement the basic visual representation of supply/demand zones on price charts
### Details:
1. Research and select an appropriate charting library (TradingView, Highcharts, or D3.js)
2. Set up the library in the project with necessary dependencies
3. Create basic chart configuration with price data display (candlesticks/bars)
4. Implement a data structure to store supply/demand zone information (price levels, timestamps, strength)
5. Create visual overlay for zones using rectangles with semi-transparent colors (green for demand, red for supply)
6. Implement zoom and pan functionality for chart navigation
7. Add hover effects to display zone details
8. Test with sample data to ensure zones render correctly at different timeframes
9. Optimize rendering performance for multiple zones

Testing approach: Create unit tests for zone data processing and visual tests for proper rendering of zones with different parameters.

## 2. Implement Price Action Display and Multi-Timeframe Switching [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Add price action visualization with entry/exit points and implement the ability to switch between different timeframes
### Details:
1. Extend the chart to display trade entry/exit markers (arrows or icons)
2. Implement data structure for storing trade information (entry/exit price, timestamp, result)
3. Create a visual layer for displaying price action patterns (pin bars, engulfing patterns, etc.)
4. Add tooltips to show trade details on hover
5. Implement timeframe selection dropdown/buttons (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d)
6. Create data aggregation logic to convert between timeframes
7. Ensure zones and trade markers scale appropriately when switching timeframes
8. Implement smooth transitions between timeframes
9. Add keyboard shortcuts for quick timeframe switching

Testing approach: Test timeframe switching with various data sets, verify correct aggregation of data, and ensure proper scaling of zones and markers across timeframes.

## 3. Implement Alert System and Custom Indicator Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Create an alert system for zone touches and implement visualization for custom indicators
### Details:
1. Design alert configuration interface (price levels, conditions, notification methods)
2. Implement real-time price monitoring logic to detect zone touches
3. Create notification system (browser notifications, sound alerts, email/SMS)
4. Add visual indicators when alerts are triggered on the chart
5. Implement alert history and management panel
6. Create framework for custom indicator visualization (moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.)
7. Implement indicator drawing on separate chart panels or as overlays
8. Add indicator parameter configuration options
9. Create indicator templates for common setups
10. Ensure indicators update correctly with timeframe changes

Testing approach: Test alert triggering with simulated price movements, verify notification delivery, and check indicator calculations against known values.

## 4. Develop Performance Analytics Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Create a comprehensive analytics dashboard to monitor trading performance and zone effectiveness
### Details:
1. Design dashboard layout with key performance metrics (win rate, profit factor, average win/loss)
2. Implement data collection for trade results and zone performance
3. Create visual charts for performance metrics (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts)
4. Add filtering capabilities by date range, instrument, and zone type
5. Implement zone effectiveness analysis (success rate of zones, average price movement)
6. Create trade journal functionality to record notes on trades
7. Add export functionality for reports (CSV, PDF)
8. Implement performance comparison between different strategies or timeframes
9. Create visual heatmap of most profitable trading times/days
10. Add real-time dashboard updates as new trades are completed

Testing approach: Test with historical trading data to verify correct calculation of statistics, check responsive design on different screen sizes, and ensure proper filtering of data.

# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Dry-Run and Backtest Modes
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create simulation capabilities for strategy validation without real money
# Details:
1. Implement dry-run mode with simulated order execution
2. Create backtest engine for historical data testing
3. Add performance metrics calculation (win rate, risk-reward, drawdown)
4. Implement Edge Multi-Factor strategy optimization
5. Create reporting functionality for backtest results

# Test Strategy:
Compare backtest results with manual analysis. Verify dry-run execution against expected outcomes. Test performance metrics accuracy against known outcomes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Dry-Run Mode with Simulated Order Execution [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a dry-run mode that simulates order execution without actually placing trades, allowing traders to validate strategies with real-time market data but no financial risk.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a DryRunExecutor class that implements the same interface as the real OrderExecutor
2. Implement order simulation logic that mimics real exchange behavior (fills, slippage, fees)
3. Add market state tracking to maintain simulated positions and balances
4. Create a toggle system to switch between live and dry-run modes
5. Implement logging for simulated trades with timestamps and execution details
6. Add configuration options for simulation parameters (fill probability, slippage models)

Testing approach:
- Unit tests comparing simulated vs. real execution paths
- Integration tests with mock market data
- Validate simulated P&L calculations against manual calculations

## 2. Build Historical Data Backtest Engine [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop a backtest engine that can replay historical market data and simulate strategy performance over past time periods.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a BacktestEngine class that processes historical data
2. Implement data loading from various sources (CSV, databases, APIs)
3. Build a time-series replay mechanism with proper event sequencing
4. Integrate with the DryRunExecutor from subtask 1 for trade simulation
5. Add speed controls (fast-forward, step-by-step execution)
6. Implement proper handling of OHLCV data and order book snapshots
7. Create time-aware context switching to ensure strategy logic uses only data available at simulation time

## 3. Implement Edge Multi-Factor Strategy Performance Metrics [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Create a comprehensive metrics system that calculates key performance indicators for the Edge Multi-Factor strategy based on backtest or dry-run results.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement core performance metrics calculations for Edge Multi-Factor Strategy:
   - Win rate and loss rate
   - Profit factor and expectancy
   - Maximum drawdown and recovery time
   - Sharpe and Sortino ratios
   - Risk-reward ratio
2. Create a MetricsCalculator class that processes trade history
3. Add time-based analysis (performance by hour, day, month)
4. Implement trade-sequence analysis for detecting patterns
5. Create visualization helpers for key metrics
6. Add specific metrics for RSI, Bollinger Band, and volatility components
7. Implement comparison metrics between different parameter sets

## 4. Develop Trade Simulation with Variable Market Conditions [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Enhance the backtest engine to simulate different market conditions and scenarios to test Edge Multi-Factor strategy robustness.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a MarketScenarioGenerator class to modify historical data
2. Implement various market condition simulations:
   - Volatility spikes and crashes

5. Create a scenario comparison system to evaluate strategy performance across conditions
6. Add specific tests for Edge Multi-Factor strategy in different regimes

## 5. Create Edge Multi-Factor Strategy Optimization Framework [done]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Build a comprehensive reporting system and parameter optimization capabilities for the Edge Multi-Factor strategy.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement detailed HTML/PDF report generation with:
   - Performance metrics tables and charts
   - Equity curves and drawdown visualization
   - Trade distribution analysis
   - Market condition performance breakdown
2. Create a ParameterOptimizer class for Edge Multi-Factor strategy tuning:
   - Grid search capability across parameter combinations
   - Genetic algorithm implementation for optimization
   - Walk-forward testing framework
3. Implement strategy comparison tools for different parameter sets:
   - Side-by-side metric comparison

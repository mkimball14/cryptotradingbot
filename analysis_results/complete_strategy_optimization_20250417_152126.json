    "general_suggestions": {
      "RSI Window": {
        "Suggested Value": 21,
        "Explanation": "Increasing the RSI window to 21 days smooths out the RSI indicator, potentially reducing the number of false signals in choppy or trending markets. This adjustment aims to improve the strategy's ability to identify more significant market reversals."
      },
      "RSI Entry (Oversold)": {
        "Suggested Value": 25,
        "Explanation": "Lowering the oversold threshold to 25 makes the strategy more conservative, entering trades only when the market shows stronger signs of being oversold. This could potentially increase the likelihood of successful trades by focusing on more pronounced market conditions."
      },
      "RSI Exit (Overbought)": {
        "Suggested Value": 75,
        "Explanation": "Raising the overbought threshold to 75 allows positions to capture more gains in strong uptrends before exiting, potentially increasing profitability in scenarios where the price continues to rise beyond the traditional overbought level."
      },
      "Bollinger Bands Window": {
        "Suggested Value": 25,
        "Explanation": "Extending the Bollinger Bands window to 25 days may provide a better representation of market volatility and trend strength by incorporating more data points. This adjustment can help in making more informed decisions on entry and exit points."
      },
      "Bollinger Bands Deviation": {
        "Suggested Value": 2.5,
        "Explanation": "Increasing the standard deviation for Bollinger Bands to 2.5 helps in identifying more extreme market conditions, potentially leading to the selection of trades with a higher probability of significant price movement."
      },
      "Volatility Window (ATR)": {
        "Suggested Value": 14,
        "Explanation": "Reducing the ATR window to 14 days makes the volatility measure more responsive to recent market changes, which could improve the strategy's adaptability to sudden increases or decreases in market volatility."
      },
      "Volatility Threshold": {
        "Suggested Value": 1.0,
        "Explanation": "Decreasing the volatility threshold to 1.0 makes the strategy more sensitive to changes in volatility, potentially leading to earlier identification of market conditions suitable for trading."
      },
      "Stop Loss Percentage": {
        "Suggested Value": 1.5,
        "Explanation": "Lowering the stop loss percentage to 1.5% reduces the risk per trade, potentially preserving capital over the long term by minimizing losses on unsuccessful trades."
      },
      "Take Profit Percentage": {
        "Suggested Value": 3.5,
        "Explanation": "Adjusting the take profit percentage to 3.5% aims to strike a better balance between capturing profits and ensuring trades do not reverse before hitting the take profit level, possibly enhancing the win rate."
      },
      "Risk Per Trade": {
        "Suggested Value": 1.5,
        "Explanation": "Reducing the risk per trade to 1.5% offers a more conservative approach to money management, potentially improving the strategy's longevity and reducing drawdowns during losing streaks."
      },
      "Additional Indicators": {
        "MACD": {
          "Explanation": "Incorporating the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) can provide additional confirmations for trade entries and exits by identifying the momentum behind market movements. This helps in filtering trades and increasing the strategy's overall effectiveness."
        },
        "Stochastic Oscillator": {
          "Explanation": "Adding a Stochastic Oscillator could enhance the strategy by identifying overbought and oversold conditions with a focus on the closing price's location relative to the high-low range. This can offer complementary signals to the RSI and potentially increase trade accuracy."

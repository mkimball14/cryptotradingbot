    "general_suggestions": {
      "RSI Window": {
        "Suggested Value": 21,
        "Explanation": "Increasing the RSI window to 21 days smoothens the RSI curve, reducing the potential for false signals in trending markets by incorporating more data points."
      },
      "RSI Entry (Oversold)": {
        "Suggested Value": 25,
        "Explanation": "Lowering the oversold threshold to 25 could help in identifying stronger reversal opportunities, aiming for entries at more extreme conditions which may result in a higher probability of bounce back."
      },
      "RSI Exit (Overbought)": {
        "Suggested Value": 75,
        "Explanation": "Raising the overbought threshold to 75 allows positions to capture more profit in strong trending conditions by waiting for more extreme overbought levels before exiting."
      },
      "Bollinger Bands Window": {
        "Suggested Value": 25,
        "Explanation": "Extending the Bollinger Bands window to 25 days can provide a smoother and potentially more reliable indicator of volatility and price extremes."
      },
      "Bollinger Bands Deviation": {
        "Suggested Value": 2.5,
        "Explanation": "Increasing the deviation to 2.5 will widen the bands, which may help in reducing the number of false breakouts or signals in highly volatile markets."
      },
      "Volatility Window (ATR)": {
        "Suggested Value": 14,
        "Explanation": "Reducing the ATR window to 14 days makes the volatility measure more responsive to recent market changes, which could be beneficial for adjusting to sudden market movements more quickly."
      },
      "Volatility Threshold": {
        "Suggested Value": 1.0,
        "Explanation": "Lowering the threshold to 1.0 makes the strategy more sensitive to changes in volatility, potentially improving the timing for entry and exit in trades."
      },
      "Stop Loss Percentage": {
        "Suggested Value": 1.5,
        "Explanation": "Decreasing the stop loss percentage to 1.5% reduces the risk per trade while allowing the strategy to maintain positions slightly longer in volatile conditions."
      },
      "Take Profit Percentage": {
        "Suggested Value": 3.5,
        "Explanation": "Lowering the take profit percentage to 3.5% could lead to a higher hit rate of reaching profit targets, potentially increasing the overall win rate of the strategy."
      },
      "Risk Per Trade": {
        "Suggested Value": 1.5,
        "Explanation": "Reducing the risk per trade to 1.5% balances the overall portfolio risk, allowing for a slightly more conservative approach that could lead to better long-term capital preservation."
      },
      "Additional Indicators": [
        {
          "Indicator": "MACD",
          "Explanation": "Adding the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) could improve the strategy by providing additional confirmation for trend direction and strength, which complements the RSI and Bollinger Bands indicators."
        },
        {
          "Indicator": "Fibonacci Retracement",
          "Explanation": "Incorporating Fibonacci Retracement levels can offer valuable support and resistance levels that are dynamically adjusted, providing a more nuanced approach to entry and exit points."
        }
      ],
      "Feature Enhancements": [
        {
          "Feature": "Adaptive Position Sizing",
          "Explanation": "Incorporating an adaptive position sizing strategy based on the confidence level of the trade signal (e.g., size up on trades with confluence of indicators) can optimize returns on high-probability trades."
        },
        {
          "Feature": "Dynamic Stop Loss and Take Profit",
          "Explanation": "Implementing dynamic stop loss and take profit levels based on current market volatility (perhaps using the ATR) could protect profits and limit losses more effectively by adapting to changing market conditions."
